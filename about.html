                    Greetings! I'm Yahaya Auwalu and my journey is shaped by a curiosity cultivated 
                    in Kano, Nigeria, propelling me through a dedicated educational pursuit in 
                    computer science. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Commencing at HIS Towers, I honed skills and insights, paving the way for 
                    subsequent roles, such as Frontend Development, where notable achievements and 
                    continuous learning marked my trajectory. Embracing transitions, each career 
                    juncture contributed to my expertise in Frontend Development.

                    Motivated by unwavering beliefs and a drive to make a positive impact, my daily 
                    motivation is grounded in “Never Give Up” I embrace lifelong learning, actively 
                    seeking professional development to stay ahead in the ever-evolving Information 
                    technology.
